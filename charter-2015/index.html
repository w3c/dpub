      <h1 id="title">Digital Publishing Interest Group Charter</h1>
      <p class="mission">The <strong>mission</strong> of the Digital Publishing Interest Group, part of the Digital Publishing Activity, is to provide a forum for experts in the digital publishing ecosystem of electronic journals, magazines, news, or book publishing (authors, creators, publishers, news organizations, booksellers, accessibility and internationalization specialists, etc.) for technical discussions towards a future vision of Digital Publishing. This vision has been detailed, and already discussed by the community, in a separate White Paper entitled <a href="http://w3c.github.io/epubweb/">“Advancing Portable Documents for the Open Web Platform: EPUB-WEB”</a>; the main message of that vision is that the current format- and workflow-level separation between offline/portable (e.g., EPUB) and online (Web) document publishing should be diminished to zero. Whilst this Interest Group is not chartered to specify Recommendations, it will provide technical directions, identify technical issues and outline solutions that relevant Working Groups of the W3C will have to finalize as final Web standards. Some of the work will have to be done in a strong cooperation with existing Working Groups at W3C or at IDPF to ensure a full compatibility with the Open Web Platform.</p>

      <div class="scope">
        <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
        <p>Today’s digital publishing market is dynamic, fast-changing, and strong. eBooks compete with printed versions, and there is a wide choice of hardware and software available for eBook readers. Journals and magazines are also made available digitally on the Web or in specialized applications and, in some cases, their printed version is even abandoned in favor of a purely digital version. The formats used by eBook readers and tablets for electronic books, magazines, journals and educational resources are largely based on W3C Technologies, such as (X)HTML, CSS, SVG, SMIL, MathML, or various Web API-s.</p>

        <p>The advancement of EPUB3 ensured the introduction of highly dynamic and interactive digital documents whose features resemble more an more to what the Web generally provides. This can be seen through a new breed of interactive books in, e.g., the educational domain, but the same technical possibilities have the potential of revolutionizing such diverse areas as journal and magazine publications (including scholarly journal publishing), archival of Web content, or in-house publishing of documentations by large corporations. The vision for the convergence of digital documents and the Web has been summarized in a separate White Paper entitled <a href="http://w3c.github.io/epubweb/">“Advancing Portable Documents for the Open Web Platform: EPUB-WEB”</a> as follows:</p>

        <blockquote><p>Our vision for EPUB-WEB is that portable documents become fully native citizens of the Open Web Platform. In this vision, the current format- and workflow-level separation between offline/portable (EPUB) and online (Web) document publishing is diminished to zero. These are merely two dynamic manifestations of the same publication: content authored with online use as the primary mode can easily be saved by the user for offline reading in portable document form. Content authored primarily for use as a portable document can be put online, without any need for refactoring the content. Publishers can choose to utilize either or both of these publishing modes, and users can choose either or both of these consumption modes. Essential features flow seamlessly between online and offline modes; examples include cross-references, user annotations, access to online databases, as well as licensing and rights management.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Turning this vision into reality, however, requires significant technical work. Some of the issues are already addressed in existing W3C Working Groups (e.g., the CSS, HTML5, or the Web Applications Working Groups) but it is very important that those activities take into account the specificities, requirements, etc., of the Digital Publishing Industry through feedbacks, comments, and direct participation in those Working Groups. There are also a number of technical challenges specific to this vision that may necessitate targeted specification work. A first set of technical challenges have been identified in the White Paper, and are added here for an easier reference:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://w3c.github.io/epubweb/#generic-archive-format-for-the-portable-offline-state">Generic archive format for the portable/offline state</a></li>

        <li><a href="http://w3c.github.io/epubweb/#document-and-fragment-identification">Document and fragment identification</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://w3c.github.io/epubweb/#metadata-discovery">Metadata: discovery</a></li>

      </ul>


      <p>However, it is not clear, at this moment, which of these challenges will require targeted work and which should be done in cooperation with existing Working Groups. In light of this, the goal of this Interest Group is to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Provide an in-depth and exhaustive overview of the technical challenges that should be solved to make the EPUB-WEB vision a reality</li>
        <li>Categorize whether these challenges should be addressed through new Working Groups or whether they should be done in cooperation with other W3C groups</li>
        <li>Provide feedbacks, comments, and requirements to other W3C Working Groups to ensure the necessary convergence, and encourage members of the Interest Group to actively participate in the work of those Working Groups whenever relevant</li>
        <li>Outline the technical solutions and necessary specifications for cases where targeted Working Groups should be established; the Interest Group should also actively contribute to the chartering of such groups</li>
      </ul>


      <p>The group is a continuation of the Digital Publishing Interest Group, that started in 2013 and whose <a href="http://www.w3.org/2013/02/digpubig.html">charter</a> expires in September 2015. That group has firmly established the presence of the Digital Publishing Community within W3C and, vice versa, the presence of W3C within the Digital Publishing Community. The results of the previous Interest Group will provide a strong basis for further work.</p>

      <div class="participation">
        <h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>
        <p>Participation in the Digital Publishing Interest Group is open to all W3C Members. Individuals who wish to participate as Invited Experts (i.e., they do not represent a W3C Member) should refer to the <a href="/2004/08/invexp.html" shape="rect">policy for approval of Invited Experts</a>. Invited Experts in this group are not granted access to Member-only information. Effective participation in the Interest Group is expected to consume one day work per week for each participant. </p>
        <p>The group may decide to create Task Forces within the Interest Group to concentrate on major relevant constituencies, for example electronic books, journal/magazine publishing, or educational publishing. These Task Forces may organize separate teleconferences, meetings, and may be responsible for one or more deliverables. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>There are no minimum requirements for participation in this group. Participants are strongly encouraged to take advantage of frequent opportunities to review and comment on deliverables from other groups.</p>
        <p>The Chair may call occasional meetings consistent with the <a href="/Consortium/Process/policies#GeneralMeetings"
            shape="rect">W3C Process requirements for meetings</a>.</p>

Administrative tasks may be conducted in Member-only communications. </p>
        <p>Information about the group (deliverables, participants, face-to-face meetings, teleconferences, etc.) is available from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/dpub/IG/">Digital Publishing Interest Group home page</a></p>
        <p>The role of <a href="#depliaisons">dependencies and liaisons</a> with various external groups is fundamental to the success of this Interest Group; the group will therefore set up active liaisons early in the process to ensure that the use cases and requirements are provided to other groups in a timely manner.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="decisions">
        <h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy</h2>
        <p>As explained in the Process Document (<a href="/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus">section
            3.3</a>), this group will seek to make decisions when there is
          consensus. When the Chair puts a question and observes dissent, after
          due consideration of different opinions, the Chair should record a
          decision (possibly after a formal vote) and any objections, and move
          on. <br />
          <br />
          A formal vote should allow for remote asynchronous
          participation—using, for example, email and/or web-based survey
          techniques. Any resolution taken in a face-to-face meeting or
          teleconference is to be considered provisional until 5 working days
          after the publication of the resolution in draft minutes sent to the
          group's mailing list. </p>
        <p>If the group decides to create Task Forces, these may be responsible
          for one or more deliverables. However, final decisions are taken at
          the Interest Group level as described above.</p>
        <p>This charter is written in accordance with <a href="/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">Section
            3.4, Votes</a> of the W3C Process Document and includes no voting
          procedures beyond what the Process Document requires. </p>

        <h2 id="patentpolicy">Patent Disclosures </h2>
        <p>The Digital Publishing Interest Group provides an opportunity to
          share perspectives on the topic addressed by this charter. W3C reminds
          Interest Group participants of their obligation to comply with patent
          disclosure obligations as set out in <a href="/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure"
            shape="rect">Section 6</a> of the W3C Patent Policy. While the
